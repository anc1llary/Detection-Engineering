# Detection Engineering

## About

This repository is a personal store of SIGMA, YARA, and Splunk based detection rule-sets created by myself unless stated otherwise.  Much of these are tested in a lab environment so behavior on a larger network may vary, so use at your own risk! 

## Other notes

Most rule-sets relating to logs will be in SIGMA, however, some functionality with Splunk is not supported by SIGMA and in those cases SPL will be used.
